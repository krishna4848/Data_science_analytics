    "- In Iris dataset with the increase in the value of k i.e., increase in the number of neighbors the accuracy was found to be increasing because model learns to predict more globally. Intially with k=1 the accuracy rate is really high (>90%) reason being the closest to any point is to itself and hence we can say that model was overfitting and predicting more locally. With increasing value of model learn to predict more globally , since it's the majority of k nearest neighbors which will decide the class of any point. But after k=10 with the increase in value of k accuracy was found to be decreasing. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Was the accuracy always affected the same way with an increase of k? Why do you think this happend?__\n",
    "- No,  as mentioned above in the case of iris dataset, intially the with increase in k, the accuracy increased because the model started predicting more globally since it's the majority of k nearest neighbors which will decide the class of any point and solves the problem of overfitting. But when the value of k becomes greater than 10 there is constant drop in accuracy of the model. Since the dataset is small the model might suffer from underfitting. Other factors that affects this is the proportion in which we divide the train and test set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- In case of heart disease dataset as well, intially with k=1 and k=5 the value of accuracy was the highest. But once the value of k goes greater than 10 there's a sharp decrease in accuracy followed a increase in the value of accuracy. \n"
